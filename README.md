# Project-Vandal
This research investigates an early method of electronic eavesdropping known as Van Eck phreaking. This is a side-channel eavesdropping method that exploits electromagnetic emanations from display hardware. The goal is to recreate this attack vector and embed it into a Free and Open Source (FOSS) platform for Chaos Engineering known as LitmusChaos.
